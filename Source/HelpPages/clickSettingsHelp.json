For example, an A/D ratio of .2 will mean all subclicks increase to full volume in 20% of their length, and then fall back to 0 volume in the remaining 80%.\nThe next three parameters tie the current volume of a song to the speed at which clicks are being generated. This prevents initial clicks from being unnaturally loud at the start of songs. \nMin Vol Freq: The click frequency at which the minimum volume is reached. \nMax Vol Freq: The click frequency at which the maximum volume is reached.\nFreq Fadeout: the minimum volume (the volume at Min Vol Freq)."
