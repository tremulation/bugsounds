For example, an A/D ratio of .2 will mean all subclicks increase to full volume in 20% of their length, and then fall back to 0 volume in the remaining 80%.\nThe next three parameters tie the current volume and randomness of a song to the speed at which clicks are being generated. This prevents initial clicks from being unnaturally loud at the start of songs, or sounding too robotic.\nFloor Freq: The cutoff frequency for the fadeout and jitter effects. This is the frequency at which those things stop. Useful for making it sound more realistic.\nStart Jitter: How much randomness to add below the floor frequency. \nStart Fade: How much to fade off the volume under the floor frequency."
