It takes the song described by the rest of the UI, and plays it dynamically through a swarm of individually-simulated insects. \n\nActivate it by pressing the power button to the left of \"Chorus Mode\" and then press and hold any midi note. As you hold the note, voices will interactively start and stop songs until the note is released. when the note is released, voices will stop coming off cooldown, allowing playing voices to finish.\n\nAll parameters, including those from the Subclick Sequencer, can be changed during playback."
